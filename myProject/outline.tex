% This is a sample document using the University of Minnesota, Morris, Computer Science
% Senior Seminar modification of the ACM sig-alternate style to generate a simple annotated

% of your sources and how you intend to use them (or not). Most of the ``content'' of the
% generated document comes from the bibliography file, including the notes field which will
% provide the annotations.

\keywords{Zero Knowledge Protocols, Compilers}

\section{Introduction}
	I will focus on Zero-Knowledge Compilers which are compilers that automatically generate Zero-Knowledge proofs. This is how I plan to use the following sources:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I expect~\cite{ZKCrypt:2012, Sigma:2009, ZKPDL:2010} to be my core sources, depending on how relevent~\cite{ZKPDL:2010} turns out to be I'll replace it with a better source.
		\item I will use~\cite{MentalGame:1987, Survey, Children:1987} for background information and examples of Zero-Knowledge Protocols. 
		\item I will need to find some papers for background information on compilers.
	\end{itemize}

	As stated above I need to find some sources about compilers. I probably will need to find more papers dealing with ZK-Compilers as well.

\section{Conclusion}

% The following two commands are all you need to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
% annotated_bibliography.bib is the name of the BibTex file containing 
% all the bibliography entries for this example. Note that you *don't* include the .bib ending
% in the \bibliography command.
\bibliography{annotated_bibliography}

% You must have a ".bib" file and remember to run:
%     pdflatex bibtex pdflatex pdflatex
% in order to see all the citation references correctly.
